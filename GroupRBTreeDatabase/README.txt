Project Two - CS400 @ UW Madison
Group: AC
TEAM: red

Things that went well for this team through project two:
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Completed the project to our best without having to fix deadlines in proposal;
2. Completed the project to our best with help not from every teammate.

Things that could be improved through future projects:
------------------------------------------------------
1. Improve the proposal next time so all classes are sufficient and useful.
2. Should make every program more simple-yet-elegant.
